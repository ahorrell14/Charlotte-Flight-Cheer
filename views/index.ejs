        Women in Computer Science is a club developed at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte to empower and support women within a male-dominated major. 
        Lasting connections and memories can be created by providing a space for women to learn and grow side-by-side. Additionally, Women in Computer Science has 
        been able to develop relationships with companies allowing our club members exclusive interviews and 
        opportunities that are not available anywhere else.
